Literally: "Flower Valley"
Built around 190AC/61BC; about the time that the Flame Knights were founded.
[[Auctorita]] caverns deep beneath the village provide fertile soil that causes various flowers to clothe the landscape that change with the season.
The community has grown as people fall in love with the locale, and remains close-knit with a fairly low resident population.
Has a level of tourism, but is distant from the [[Capital]] and its influence.
The [[Auctorita Mine|caverns]] have had their entrances sealed for lack of need to enter and the associated danger. Nevertheless, the town is peaceful because the monsters have no need for the surface, and only fight to protect [[Auctorita]] from the others.
The [[Auctorita Mine|cavern]] hosts significant plant life. The nourishing light of the [[Auctorita]] promoted their growth in spite of the lack of sunlight. The "monster" that injures [[Fennel]] is actually a carnivorous flower(?)
