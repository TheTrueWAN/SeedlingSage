<b>I need the name of the village before the Flame Knights got there. And probably a better one for thereafter.</b>
The mountainside town in which the [[Order of the Flame Knights]] was founded.
Before the [[Order of the Flame Knights]] was founded, the village was comprised of [[Monster Hunter]]s that retrieved [[Auctorita]] for the first time from [[Auctorita Mine]]s. They developed a technique to use the crystal to warm their homes in spite of the harsh winters. The mine is not discussed with outsiders for fear that they get hurt.
When the Crown's soldiers passed by the village to conquer it, the residents saw no need for resistance for they understood that nothing would change for them; the terrain alone made the journey of the soldiers arduous, and they didn't have anything of value except the [[Auctorita]] that they withheld from the soldiers.

When a small band of soldiers returned upon completing their time in the campaign, they returned to the [[Flame Knight's Founding|village]] and integrated into the community, learning about [[Auctorita]] and concluding that it could be an asset in a fight. Thus they began studying and training, This is the birth of the [[Order of the Flame Knights]].

Razed in 4AD by the [[Revolutionaries]]. It is said that no stone stands upon another in this place, and precious few people know about what transpired there, and fewer bore witness.
There was rising tension between the [[Revolutionaries]] and the Flame Knights when the former came upon the village. There were people in both parties that sought violence and others that sought diplomacy. Both parties communicated courteously with each other.
They came to a deal that the [[Revolutionaries]] be given access to [[Auctorita]], so long as no one gets hurt. Now, the [[Revolutionaries]] were given orders before travelling to the village that they should destroy the Flame Knights that they encounter. The commander of the [[Revolutionaries]] intended to not mention their involvement out of respect for their past deeds, to himself and to his family (he had personally been saved by them years ago). Rigid members of the [[Revolutionaries]] initiated the fight in the village; and then insisted upon their bloody victory that there should be no witnesses to the event here, for it would damage the reputation of the fledgling government. They took all the [[Auctorita]] they could carry and returned to the government, claiming that they found a [[Auctorita Mine|vein of Auctorita]] and were attacked by monsters.
Now, if the government did find out about how [[Auctorita]] was rediscovered, the majority would have condemned the people who initiated the massacre, in spite of its necessity to maintain the early order.
