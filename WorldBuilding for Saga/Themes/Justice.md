It's a big topic, the explorations of justice found in Saga lie within the different people and factions.
Justice is equality.
	Represented by the [[Revolutionaries]].
Justice is punishment.
	Initially represented by [[Fennel]]. Also the [[Construct Army]]
Justice is taking action to make right that which is wrong.
	[[Fennel]]'s final understanding of the subject.
Justice does not favour anyone.
Justice is administered solely by the law.
	Represented by the [[Construct Army]] and the Government.

Other considerations:
Death is the punishment God assigns to sin. We all deserve it. The atrocities and abuses we commit against every human life that God loves deserves to be punished in kind.
Through death God prevents evil from lasting on the Earth forever, for eventually the evil will die. This doesn't prevent inheritance but it limits the influence of the individual; making each of them guilty for bearing the evil torch of their "parent".
