1 Corinthians 13:1 - 7
"Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast, it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful (or: does not count upon wrongdoing); " it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. Loves bears all things; believes all things; hopes all things; endures all things.
Also the greatest love is self sacrifice.

This is a good framework for love to work with. Different characters can capture different elements of love.

Fennel should begin with the understanding of love in the grand (the Flame Knight's creed: "burn all you have to pull those you love out of the fire"). Her arc is to discover love in the mundane: small kindnesses.
