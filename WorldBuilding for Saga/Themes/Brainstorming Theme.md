Should be Christian, but with enough subtlety that it points to Christ, but not such that people whine about it being a bad story if the Christian aspect is not understood (like the Lion the Witch and Wardrobe movie in which the setup for Aslan's resurrection is not complete in my opinion). I suppose that it should simply be about Christian values.
God:
-[[Love]]
-Power
-[[Justice]]
-Forgiveness
-Truth
-Mercy
Jesus:
-Friendship
-Sacrifice
-Wisdom
I should write what I know, and I have spent a long time pondering love. Let's go with that. 
Also the intersect of love and justice. I have thought about punishing those you love; this brings me onto the topic of mercy.

Elsewhere I have being pondering meaning and motive; why is it that we do anything? And why can't I do what I want to do, even if it is well within my power to do so.
I suppose that questions of purpose could also arise later in the Saga.
