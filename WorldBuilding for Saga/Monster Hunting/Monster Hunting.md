[[Auctorita Mine]]s host unique monsters that reflect the locale they live in. People have discovered with time that they are a source of rare materials that may revolutionise life in the kingdom.
One such monster that could rip souls from people was the source of the accident that culminated in the development of [[Construct]] technology. <b>Note: emphasise that this process is otherworldly and beyond human's ability to harness; a force of nature more than a product of science. Humans don't have power of their souls after all. They can get it to occur but that is all the power they have.</b>
Some people aspire to be [[Monster Hunter]]s. Those that spend their lives studying the monsters and killing those that threaten them.
