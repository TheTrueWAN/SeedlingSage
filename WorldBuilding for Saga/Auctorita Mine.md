<b>The term "mine" is here used loosely to describe a place where Auctorita naturally occurs. It doesn't describe a place built by man, although he may excavate in search of it.</b>
[[Auctorita]] is a precious gem that is dug from the ground. Its power may warp the surrounding earth. This leads to beautiful but dangerous cave systems and locales. Monsters reside near [[Auctorita]] and fight to protect it; trying to horde the evolutionary advantages that [[Auctorita]] provides them.
Mines thus are dangerous places and an armed escort accompanies the miners.
Legally only the government can initiate mining operations so as to minimise the loss of life, but this doesn't stop criminals from trying.
Something of a "mystery dungeon" that promotes locale diversity.

<b>Contradiction, how come there are all those unique environments but it takes so long to discover its source?</b>
I guess that it would simply be taken for granted and people just didn't want to fight the monsters that guard the Auctorita.
<b>Then what would make the Flame Knight's Founding any different?</b>
