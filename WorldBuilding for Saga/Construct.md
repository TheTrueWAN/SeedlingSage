The greatest achievement of [[Auctorita]] research. The crystal heart of [[Auctorita]] imprinted with a human soul/mind animating a human-like "frame". They are human but seem otherworldly to the common man for their limited range of expression.

Those who become constructs are closely monitored by the [[Guild of Auctorita]] for the first while to prevent illegal and erratic behaviour that abuses the power they have.
When people are transferred they need to be taught how to move a Construct body. It is not built of nerves like a human one but instead moved near telekinetically; *Could the crystal heart power various "motor" elements in the construct frame in order to move? Telekinesis is supposed to be unfeasible after all.*

Crystal Heart
	The mind/soul of the person is stored in the [[Auctorita]]. Thus damage to the crystal will dramatically affect the person, be it there memory or personality or cognitive ability.
	The crystal powers the frame it resides in. The crystal generates energy at a consistent rate to power the frame and any magic it casts. The generation rate exceeds consumption from regular behaviour, so surplus is stored in the frame/core <b>(where is the surplus energy stored?)</b>. The heart can also be overcharged by consuming more energy than the heart can generate. This leads to the crystal degrading and eventually exploding if pushed far enough. The Construct is always aware of their energy reserve as a human is aware of their fatigue. Energy can also be transferred between [[Auctorita]], so between crystal hearts; constructs can collaborate to achieve great feats.
<b>The plan is that over the course of the saga, there will be instances where Fennel will overcharge her core, eventually leading to her final rest over the course of generations.</b>

Transfer Process
	A closely guarded secret of the [[Guild of Auctorita]]. Only practitioners of the imprint know it.
	In any case, the process is intrusive and causes the human body to invariably die. The subject is sedated beforehand because of this and to ensure the secrecy of the process.
<b>Note that the process creates an imprint of the soul; a copy. The human who walks in dies and a construct replacement walks out. These are distinct people. However, the only person who knows this is the human who dies (because they experience death), from all other perspectives one would conclude that a transfer occured.</b> 
The Face
	The face of a construct lacks a mouth; the lower part of the face is carved to give the impression that the mouth is behind a mask. This is because Constructs communicate by causing air to vibrate (using the [[Auctorita]] directly or by using some purpose-built organ in the frame?), but animating a mouth in all its detail is nigh an impossibility in both design and action. Thus to maintain the impression that the Construct is human, the mask is preferred to a still mouth or a flopping block of wood at the jaw.
	The eyes are [[Auctorita]] crystals. They glow to reflect the state of the heart. They tend to pulse when the [[Construct]] is speaking.
