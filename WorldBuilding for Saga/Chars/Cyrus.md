Young man
[[Apothecary]]
Greatly values all human life; seeks to save everyone. Carries a magical satchel that can store an infinite number of items and the wearer can take any one item that he needs; this was gifted to him early on his journey as an apothecary. 
Not magically adept but compensates with his concoctions.
