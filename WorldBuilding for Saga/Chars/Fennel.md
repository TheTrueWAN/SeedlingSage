[[Construct]] Soldier (feminine)
Note the floriography for the fennel flower has evolved,
	Flattery, adultery or strength, immortality. Depends on the era. Flattery is most frequent.
Left the [[Construct Army]] after she decided that following orders avoidably got people hurt.
Values freedom but has seen the necessity of order.
Very serious character, focused on the mission. Rather quiet.

The purpose of Fennel is to reflect the evolution of my own understanding of the world and my beliefs and my faith.
Love in the grand -> love in the mundane
Forgiveness of others -> also forgiveness of self
A lack of purpose in living; "Why is it that you fight? That you rise in the morning to a day of endless toil, to see no other reward than its reoccurrence tomorrow?" -> serving for the glory of God (Not sure how to put this one in...)



-History
	Early Life: pre-construct
		Grew up with her parents: the Flame Knights [[Roland]] and [[Sarah]]. And her two younger brothers in the village of [[Fleurvale]].
		She aspired to be a knight, having grown up on the stories and legends that her parents would recall from their time serving the Crown. She would help out around the town, but focused on becoming a capable fighter to protect people. The people of [[Fleurvale]] thought her adventurous and a little precocious, but never any trouble.
		The plan is to have some other person (one of the children?) go to the Auctorita cavern beneath the town by unearthing one of the entrances or something. They go down and encounter the monster, as they run away the lead the monster to the surface. Fennel then tries to be the Flame Knight she dreams of being and fights the monster. While she fights someone informs [[Roland]] and then he saves her, but only after she has been injured.
		<b></b>
		*After the physical impediment has been established, the story continues:*
		She couldn't carry the legacy of her parents as a result. An insufferable year *(or half year?)* of being incapable of doing anything later, Fennel receives word that the [[Guild of Auctorita]] developed research on a technology known as [[Construct]]s, and there was the successful example of the [[Age of Democracy|disabled man]]. **Maybe have the disabled man go on a tour of the country to show off the new technology, or maybe he always wanted to come to Fleurvale, and his new body gave him the opportunity. Thus Fennel would get to see in person the technology that she hopes will change her life.**
		To have a fully functional body again becomes Fennel's greatest objective. Seeing as she will eventually discard her body for the new one, she decides to focus on training her mind. She studies long and hard, and initially her parents try to persuade her to become comfortable with what she still has, for becoming a [[Construct]] would mean that she serves in the [[Construct Army]]. Because this does not present itself to be dissimilar to being a [[Order of the Flame Knights|Flame Knight]] (one of her arc will be the distinction between a "soldier" and a "knight"), Fennel marches on to achieve her goal. She wins over the heart of the people with the little kindnesses she can bestow to people and her determination to chase a goal so far beyond their imagining.
	Personality Traits during Early Life:
		-Doesn't want to be a burden to others, and thus apologises when she receives help from others.
		-Very polite to the people around her because she thinks she is imposing on them.
		-Has a fierce sense of justice and a reverence for the [[Order of the Flame Knights]] and the ideals that they stand for, built on the stories of her parents and their motto: "Burn all you have to pull those you love out of the fire". At the moment, her ideals are borrowed and borne of her parents instead of herself; they have not been under thorough scrutiny yet.
		-Knowledgeable and a critical thinker from her study
		-Patient from her physical impediment slowing everything she does.
		-Having lived in [[Fleurvale]], she learns the [[Floriography|Language of Flowers]]. Enjoying its subtlety and the beauty of nature.
		-Is she traumatised from her encounter with the monster that crippled her? Does this affect her love of flowers or fear of monsters?
		**-I want Fennel to go on an arc about love similar to the evolution of my understanding. Specifically, the Flame Knight's creed represents love in the grand, but it doesn't capture love in the mundane; the little kindnesses we can do for each other. We don't always need to risk our lives to prove our love. Now, if Fennel already performs the little kindnesses because that is all she can do, she will begin the arc already holding its conclusion.
		The solution would be that she doesn't quite grasp how much her kindness means to others. Some other character will have the opportunity to teach her that later.**
	Transfer to [[Construct]]
		Fennel's preliminary application to the [[Guild of Auctorita]] to become a [[Construct]] is successful. Fennel, [[Sarah]] and [[Roland]] prepare to travel to the capital for the transfer. Most of the town comes to say goodbye.
		Fennel travels with her parents to the capital. Both are apprehensive about the procedure going wrong, but are supportive. Her brothers will protect the village while they are away.
		During the journey Fennel learns about her parents; she hasn't really seen them travel before, and they way they handle conflict on the road causes them to grow closer in their final hours together.
		It is clearly impressed upon [[Fennel]] by her parents that they are not to mention their history or support of the Flame Knights.
		When they arrive at the [[Guild of Auctorita]], Fennel is interviewed by the guild members to ensure that she is a suitable candidate to become a [[Construct]]. She also performs some written exams to prove her aptitude,
		Her years of study makes passing the tests easy enough, although when asked about why she wants to be a [[Construct]], she pauses as she cannot say the Flame Knights' Creed. Instead she says that she was inspired by the disabled man, and that she wanted to be stronger to protect the kingdom she loves. The examiner finds the answer agreeable and signs off on the transfer. Fennel gets to have some influence concerning her frame (the process remains bespoke) and then the transfer is performed.
		She selects a feminine frame with a focus on strength and speed so that she can wield a greatsword. It's a bit smaller than other frames but it makes it easier to move. The human Fennel is a little shorter than other people, so is about the same height as her frame.
		They then go to the transfer laboratory. Fennel is sedated while her parents wait outside. <b>Consider foreshadowing that Fennel dies here and is replaced by giving the scene a little more weight and finality than everyone expects, maybe only one or two of the project leaders know what is about to happen.</b>
		The transfer is otherwise uneventful and so Fennel becomes a [[Construct]]. She then is given a brief time with her parents and then is sent to the [[Construct Army Academy]] to learn to be a [[Construct]] soldier.
	The purpose of Fennel spending time in the army is to acid test Fennel's ideals of being a Flame Knight as she will disagree to some of the methods used by the Army. How will she react to her borrowed ideals and values being scrutinised?
		-Erode the values that Fennel espoused during her time as a human, she later will be reminded of them for some reason and have a moral awakening; she then comes to develop her own set of values and either decides to leave (abandoning her duty to her country -> regret), or standing firm and enduring having to inflict cruelties upon others (hurting others -> regret).
		-She stands firm to her ideals and suffers as a result, she considers whether her borrowed ideals are worth holding on to, and someone or some event causes her resolve to harden and she holds on.
		-She plays along but secretly nurtures a grudge against the cruel system she sees. She intends to change it or escape at the first opportunity. Maybe she is inspired to hold on to her duty to her country, even if it is a bloody one. Or maybe she deserts the army and it becomes a source of shame for the rest of her life.
		In deserting the army, she stops fighting for them. In spite of her moral leanings everyone does concede that she is a valuable asset in any situation that she is in. Maybe she leaves some friends she makes behind, and this causes them to get hurt. She then regrets abandoning her duty and abandoning her friends.
	Time in [[Construct Army Academy]]:
		Her previous eight-ish years of training mean that she only really struggled with the practical; despite her mental exercises she still was uncoordinated for a long time. I suppose she would spend many hours just practicing moving around as a [[Construct]].
		

*<b>SCRAPPED IDEAS</b>*

-"Hybrid Core":
	Affects her emotion and thinking; or used to telegraph her emotions and what she is thinking
	Has a "red" part and "blue" part.
	The red part is more utilitarian and cold towards others.
	The blue part is more empathetic, compassionate and emotionally intelligent. (Link: this could be relate to the idea of a "heart of blood" and a "heart of tears")
	Fennel's eyes change colour according to if her red or blue aspect is in effect. Her eyes default to being purple - a blend of both - and the halves can become more or less dominant depending on her will and her circumstance.
	There is also a "gold heart" mode in which the aforesaid come together to form a sum greater than its parts. Characterized by justice and the strength to administer it.
<b>This is a relic from the idea that the crystal heart was dipped in blood or tears to cause the construct to have a disposition to certain ways of thinking and emotion. It might make for a cool plot device in a visual medium, but making frequent references to it in writing is really slow.</b>

<b>I was unsure of how Fennel becomes injured; I need something for Fennel to do that proves her character and creates a need for her to become a construct in order to fulfil her desire to be a knight</b>
		When she was 8~10 years old, the village was attacked by bandits. Her parents fought, as did she. However, during the fighting they split up to defend different ends of the valley, and Fennel found herself fighting a huge bear of a man. She was severely injured, and only survived because [[Roland]] managed to intervene in time. This was the first time that Fennel saw her father fight. The battle left a mark on her and why she wants to be a knight; so that no one else suffers the fate she was saved from.
		Her injury caused her to quickly fatigue when performing menial physical tasks. 
		*Alternative theories*
		Fennel contracts or was born with an illness that dramatically affects her physical ability.
		She gets involved in an accident that disables her; maybe of her own adventurous nature going too far; she learns that she burdened others with her antics.
		She protects the town from a monster instead of bandits.
		She goes exploring the [[Auctorita Mine|Auctorita caverns]] beneath [[Fleurvale]]. On a fateful occasion she encounters one of the monsters and is seriously injured, teaching her that she should pay more heed to her parents' warnings. Maybe she inhaled some spores or suffers a physical injury. Her parents would figure out what is happening (maybe Fennel's brothers tell them) and then they save her.
		
-"The Sword that Eats The Light" ("The Moonlit Blade")
	Can absorb surrounding light to recharge her crystal heart. The sword grows brighter in the process. This causes people facing Fennel to focus on her sword as their eyes are drawn to the light. The sword was stolen by Fennel after she had left the [[Construct Army]].
	In time it becomes the signature of a legend.
<b>I'm unsure about this idea. It makes Fennel very overpowered compared to everyone around her, and such a weapon does not explain why no one else possesses one; most excuses have a level of contrivance about them. Maybe something simpler would work instead?</b>
