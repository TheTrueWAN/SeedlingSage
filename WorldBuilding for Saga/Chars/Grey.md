Somewhere between young and middle aged man.
[[Gun Knight]]

Aspires to execute an uncompromising and perfect justice. Knows that he will never attain this loft goal, but doesn't trust anyone else to do it.

Past:
Went on various missions in which he collaborated with [[Eve]]. Here he grew to like her.
Doesn't know who the [[Puppet Master]] is but somewhat agrees with her actions, but the use of the forbidden human control magic means that he would arrest the her if he had the chance.
