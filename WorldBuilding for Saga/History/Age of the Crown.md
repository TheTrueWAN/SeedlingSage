Recorded history begins here: 
0AC (0 years after the beginning of the Age of the Crown).
The Crown and his kingdom was established. The first kings were great warriors who forged territory for their people with their collective blood.
A nation grew from a city.
<b>RESEARCH ROME AND HOW THEY CONQUERED EVERYWHERE, CONSIDER FOLLOWING SOME OF THEIR THEORY.</b>
~135AC
The natives of a [[Flame Knight's Founding|village]] the Crown conquered were their first contact with [[Auctorita]]. Natives used a curious crystal to warm their homes. While this was a curious practice, most thought little of it and since the village agreed to be a part of the Crown's kingdom they soon left.

<b>I need a better excuse for why Auctorita was initially ignored</b>

However, a small collection of soldiers took note of this practice of using this glowing rock to light fire, and after their campaign returned to the [[Flame Knight's Founding|village]], learning from the natives and began developing combat techniques with [[Auctorita]]. This is the origin of the [[Order of the Flame Knights]].
~145AC
The [[Order of the Flame Knights]] first records come from this period. Their deeds were found in song and ink. All were of how they saved and protected people. While accounts differ in the specifics, it is agreed that Flame Knights fought with fire (real shocker right there...).
The village where the Flame Knights were founded in still stands, but the harsh environment they live in has stunted their growth. The Flame Knights keep the [[Flame Knight's Founding]] safe and secret.
~154AC
The deeds of the Flame Knights reaches the Crown. Negotiation between the parties leads to an agreement: There will be no investigation into the secret of the Flame Knights' fire, but they will serve the Crown in his campaigns.
-160AC-210AC
The Flame Knights perform campaigns for the Crown. They are renowned for their bravery and how they lay down their lives for the people; believing in their creed: "Burn all you have to pull those you love out of the fire".
-211AC
With the known world conquered, the Crown lavishes rewards on those who fought for it. The rewards included land and wealth that they allowed them to live comfortably. Many accept the offer, while some disappear to the [[Flame Knight's Founding]]. The majority agree to return to serve the Crown should ever there be a need. Contact amongst the Flame Knights is limited to writing and occasional travel.
-216AC
People among the lower classes have a growing contempt for the Crown and contempt for the Flame Knights that took the Crown's reward. Some of the retired Flame Knights became greedy landlords or money lenders; their greed tarnishing their once irreproachable name. This marks the birth of the [[Revolutionaries]]. They begin plotting a democratic transition, members are divided with force is necessary.
-225AC
There is a revolution in which the monarchy is overthrown and replaced with a democracy. The Flame Knights are called by the Crown to protect it, but arrive too late to act. Upon arrival to the capital the revolutionists trick and attack them. A fraction of the Flame Knights survive, but their name is marred because they represent the enemy of the people: an arm of the Crown. Many Flame Knights are bitter, for their duty was always to the people and now those that they served have betrayed them. Flame Knights who had poor reputation amongst their locals were also cast out or killed at about the same time or soon thereafter with the help of the [[Revolutionaries]].

<b>Maybe the national soldiers that served the Crown are in a similar position to the Flame Knights; they either joined the Revolutionaries or were similarly treated.</b>
