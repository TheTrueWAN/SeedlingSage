-0 AD / 251AC
With the fall of the crown came the rise of a democratic leadership. The political leaders of the revolutionists form a system of guilds. Each guild manages a different aspect of life.
-0-4AD
[[Revolutionaries]] use the strength of the the national soldiers to terrorize and hunt down the remaining Flame Knights who lived further from the capital. They eventually came upon the [[Flame Knight's Founding|old village]] where the [[Order of the Flame Knights]] was founded. This is when [[Auctorita]] was rediscovered.
The Flame Knights that resided there were willing to negotiate with the [[Revolutionaries]] that entered the town. However there were people in both parties that wanted to destroy the other.
While a deal had been struck to allow the unrestricted access and study of [[Auctorita]], someone started a fight between the Flame Knights and Revolutionaries. After the Revolutionaries won, they elected to kill the rest of the villagers who witnessed the uncharacteristic behaviour of the "good guys" for fear that "their lies" that the Revolutionaries initiated the fight would hinder the Democratic Revolution. Thus the village was brought to ruin and all the [[Auctorita]] that they could carry was sent to the capital for study. While reports of these events mention the acquisition of [[Auctorita]] found in a village, there is no mention of the Flame Knights nor the location of the village nor how a great number of the outbound party had died.
5AD
With the rediscovery of [[Auctorita]] a new guild is set up to study it.
7~8AD
After 2~3 years of study, the [[Guild of Auctorita]] develop other magical techniques connected with [[Auctorita]].
9AD
Development of Construct technology begins. There was an accident at an [[Auctorita Mine]] in which a miner died, but an [[Auctorita]] shard began to act on its own. It demonstrated sentience and attempted to create markings on surfaces around it. Scholars think that his soul was transferred into the shard. Study began on how to control and exploit this potential avenue to immortality.
21AD
After eleven years of development, the first successful [[Construct]] is created. A disabled man was the test subject. These findings are presented to the public, although the exact methodology of how one becomes a [[Construct]] is withheld for understandable security purposes. Some look forward to the future, while others contemplate a [[Construct]]'s humanity. others dread a time when [[Construct]] conversion will become mandatory.
22AD
[[Fennel]] first hears word of the development of [[Construct]]s about half a year later; the news was slow to travel into the remote countryside of [[Fleurvale]]; she begins her study anew.
22-24AD
The government develops the legislation concerning [[Construct]]s and their existence. Being experimental, they must spend at least five years under supervision from the [[Guild of Auctorita]], extendable by however much the guild sees fit. During this time they may go about serving some guild of the government. They may then be registered as a licensed [[Construct]]; they have proven their trustworthiness and are thereon treated like regular citizens, at least by the law.
24AD
After much bureaucracy, the [[Construct Army]] is developed. People who become [[Construct]]s can spend their five years under the government serving to ensure the nation's security. The first unit is made and comprised of a small number of [[Construct]]s who develop battle tactics and codes of operation.
30AD
The [[Construct Army]] remains young, but is now a capable military force. Due to the disparity between the strength of man and [[Construct]], units remain small and agile to threats.
