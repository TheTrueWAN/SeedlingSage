The language of flowers used in the saga should be standardised so as to ensure communication is clear. To this end the language of flowers according to the Victorians is used.


"_There is a language, little known, 
Lovers claim it as their own._
_Its symbols smile upon the land,_
_Wrought by nature’s wondrous hand;_
_And in their silent beauty speak,_
_Of life and joy, to those who seek_
_For Love Divine and sunny hours_
_In the language of the flowers._"
–The Language of Flowers, London, 1875
