In the Victorian Language of Flowers (see the pdf), the Fennel is "strength" or "worthy of praise". Maybe the flower could be chosen by [[Roland]] and then it sticks.



The internal pith of the fennel stalk quickly catches fire but burns slowly, the encasing stalk is left behind. Prometheus stole fire by hiding it in a hollow fennel stalk.<b>In the same way could the character Fennel be the torch of a fire, burning her very self to save others? This would align with the plan that she slowly degrades her core to save others across her long lifespan.</b>
It was eaten by fasting Christians in Italy who to stave off hunger. This lead to the phrase: "give fennel", to mean temporary but not fulfilling; flattery. This idea is also found in the works of Shakespeare.
Classical civilisation (Roman, Greek) would say it meant good health
The Greeks called the flower "marathon". We derive the idea of a marathon run from the informant who ran from "Marathon" (the plain of Fennel flowers where the battle of Marathon took place) to Athens to announce the victory of the battle.
