<b>Fey bind love story</b>
	ref: comment on video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj2bE3Qggnc&list=WL&index=30 (accessed 28/4/2025) by "derkskalde4973". The below is my summary:
	A fae maiden falls in love with a boy. However, in polite fae society, it is not proper for a fae to fall in love with a mere human, and so the maiden develops a strategy to save face and get the boy: she casts some kind of binding spell that forces her to stay with the boy, as a result, she has to spend time with him until the spell can be undone, and it's not her fault that she has to spend time with him, she is bound to him and it isn't her fault.
	While the two do become friends, the boy is unaware that the maiden is a fae and the maiden's romantic attractions whereas the maiden yearns for her feelings to be reciprocated, but she needs to achieve this while maintaining their friendship. The feelings of the fae are far stronger than those of a human after all.
	Thus she must juggle:
	Getting the boy to fall in love with her.
	Maintaining and developing their relationship.
	Maintaining the appearance that she would like to escape the bind that keeps her with the boy without actually escaping it.
	Preventing the efforts of her family and others in the fae society that try to rescue her from the spell bind.
	There may also be some friction where humans think that it is wrong for a man to love a fae.
	This sounds like a lot of fun, I just need to adjust the premise so that it better fits the Seedling Saga. I won't be having any other "race" in my world apart from human and [[Construct]].
