Foreach book, have it be called "Seedling Saga abc" where "abc" is the year that the book occurs in, and "c" is the release order of the book.
After the Seedling Saga concludes, follows with the "Bloom Saga", then the "Wither Saga"; something like that if the story is worth writing.
This does mean that there is expected to be something of a flower motif across the saga; I will have to look into that.
