Existence of "magic" mages and "magic" Constructs at the same time. This adds a layer of complexity to the world as both are connected to the same thing: auctorita; the distinction between them appears to be trivial.
I think that magic is cool and I would like magic, but it does complicate matters as the reader will have to understand it at some point.
The initial plan for simplicity was:
Auctorita -> Constructs

It has now become:
Auctorita-> Auctorita Mine -> Monsters -> Monster Hunting 
Auctorita -> Constructs -> Construct Soldiers
Auctorita -> Guild of Auctorita -> Study Magic -> Mages
Auctorita -> Flame Knights -> Overthrown Crown -> Council of Guilds

There is a lot of things that are tied to the one world-changing mechanic.
The heart of Auctorita is that it is the power to change some fringe of reality, be it places, people, flora, fauna.
I probably could handle the expanded idea of Auctorita, but it does mean that I have to be careful to drip feed this fantastical element to the reader. It also makes dipping into the series partway becomes difficult as the story builds the world and then on itself; I suppose that the best solution is that each entry only handles one or two aspects of Auctorita, so that the individual book is not overwhelming, but the whole is cohesive.
