If [[Auctorita]] warps locales to make [[Auctorita Mine]]s, how does this affect people and buildings when the Auctorita is used?
*Possible solution: Auctorita is not a "force of nature" but instead a force that bends to nature's will. Monsters or an older people used Auctorita to build the continent. This could be the origin of the Creation Myth of the World*
