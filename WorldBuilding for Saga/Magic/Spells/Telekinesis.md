Thought to be among the most dangerous kinds of magic one can study. The idea of defining a "body" to "move" was a difficult process. Early experiments on everyday objects effectively involved carrying an object by a single point. Accelerating objects often caused the object to tear, as force is applied to a single point of it. There exist multiple gravestones and marks in and around the [[Guild of Auctorita]]'s laboratories noting the time, date and what body part had been removed in a foolhardy experiment. Developments in understanding centre of mass and development of equipment designed to lift humans by a point improved the safety of telekinesis. It remains the most prolific killer of [[Auctorita]] apprentice scholars.
The best telekinetics can manipulate three or four different points of at a time.
