The primary mechanic of magic is that it channels "energy" to rewrite an element of reality.
Thus magic requires a source of "energy" in order to do anything, primarily [[Auctorita]].
The definition of "rewrite reality" is vague and thus many magical abilities can be used and created. However, the system also demands that mages have an understanding of the science that they are warping, otherwise they will have unexpected consequences, serious mistakes have lead to a number of people becoming mutilated or dying.

[[Construct]]s are the result of a freak accident that was harnessed by the [[Guild of Auctorita]]. While the principle of imprinting a human mind onto a crystal is understood intuitively, the actual science is still beyond understanding.
